That is the name of our group.
Welcome to the Github of 0LM180 Practice Assignment Group 3!

# Github setup
In this Github, you'll find several files. Firslty, you'll find two solvers. These are the solvers as explained in the report. There is a special one for the sweep. Unless you want to edit this, you will not have to touch these. The main programs call whatever solver they need.

This bring us to the main programs. There are four mains. The one called "main" is the one described in the report, and the one you should use if you want to solve a parameter set. However, three additional mains are present. Their names explains their use. In order, they were used for:

- The deterministic model, which was used by use to put in a trajectory of growth and find out what that would cost (bypassing the iterator).
- The parameter sweeps
- The time / spread sweep

In general, these are not are clean since you should not have to use these directly.

# Doubling time
Lastly, there is a folder for the code used to determine the doubling time, as shown in the Formal model chapter. This code gave us the doubling time and fit factors.
